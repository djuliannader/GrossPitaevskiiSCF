clone as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/djuliannader/GrossPitaevskiiSCF.git
```

## Data 

This repository provides data and codes for the paper Critical Energies and Wigner Functions of the Stationary States of the Bose Einstein Condensates in a Double-Well Trap, by D. J. Nader and E. Serrano-Ensastiga. The paper is published in open acces in Adv Quantum Technol. The repository is currently being developed; please await its completion. The repository contains a Mathematica notebook, necessary to recreate the Figures of the article.

## Environment Requirements  

To run this repository, please make sure the following environment is available:

- LinearAlgebra (stdlib)  
- PyPlot


## Usage

- For the stationary states, navigate to the /src manipulate the parameters from the file input.dat and execute as:

```bash
julia main.jl
```
